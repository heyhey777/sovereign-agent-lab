Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

# Describe what CALM did after the out-of-scope message. Min 20 words.
CONVERSATION_3_WHAT_HAPPENED = """
CALM did not try to answer the out-of-scope request itself. Instead, it stated that it could only help with confirming tonight's venue booking and redirected the user back to the booking flow.
"""

# Compare Rasa CALM's handling of the out-of-scope request to what
# LangGraph did in Exercise 2 Scenario 3. Min 40 words.
OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
In Exercise 2, the LangGraph agent either gave a vague generic reply or tried to reason more openly about what it could do. Here, CALM stayed tightly inside its defined scope, refused the unrelated bouncy-castle request, and redirected the conversation back to the booking flow. That makes CALM more predictable and safer for a structured confirmation task.

I uncommented the cutoff guard in actions.py, restarted the action server, and ran a booking conversation after 16:45 with 160 guests, about 50 vegan, and a £200 deposit. The agent escalated immediately because it was too late to process the confirmation before the 5 PM deadline.
"""

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules
#
# What does this simplification cost? What does it gain?
# Min 30 words.

CALM_VS_OLD_RASA = """
We havent used the old RASA but I see that the new RASA is easier to setup and more reliable


Think about:
- What does the LLM handle now that Python handled before?
- What does Python STILL handle, and why (hint: business rules)?
- Is there anything you trusted more in the old approach?
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.
# Min 40 words.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
We havent used the old RASA but I see that the new RASA is easier to setup and more reliable


Be specific. What can the Rasa CALM agent NOT do that LangGraph could?
Is that a feature or a limitation for the confirmation use case?
Think about: can the CALM agent improvise a response it wasn't trained on?
Can it call a tool that wasn't defined in flows.yml?
